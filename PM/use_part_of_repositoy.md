# Small part of the repository
It was only used on a website a small piece of the repository.
If you want to use this information you should use the script *src/short_dataset.sh* to clone only the necessary files.
When you have all the files you onlu have to execute the files that you have in *src/* directory:
1. unizp_basic_files.sh
2. insert_basic_tables.sh

### Notes
- The first time that the script is executed takes a lot of time.
